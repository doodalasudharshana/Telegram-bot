<p>B.R. Ambedkar was a leading activist and social reformer who dedicated his life, working for the upliftment of the Dalits (the untouchables) and the socially backward class of India. A messiah for the downtrodden, Ambedkar continuously fought for the eradication of caste discrimination that had fragmented the Indian society. Born in a socially backward family, Ambedkar was the victim of caste discrimination, inequality, and prejudice. However, fighting against all odds, he received higher education, becoming the first ever untouchable to do so. After completing his studies, he launched himself politically, fighting for the rights of the depressed class and against the inequality practiced in the society. He was a crusader of social equality and justice. Academically trained as a jurist, he went on to become the first law minister of free India and the framer or chief architect of the ‘Constitution of India.’ In his later years, he acted as a revivalist of Buddhism in India. He converted to Buddhism, freein     g himself of the perils of caste differences and unfairness practiced by the Hindus.
